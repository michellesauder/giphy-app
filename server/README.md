Here's a basic README.md for your Go backend application:

# Go React Giphy App Backend

This repository contains the backend server for the Go React Giphy App. It is built using the Go programming language and serves as the backend component responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving data to the frontend application.

## Features

- Handles incoming HTTP requests and provides responses based on the requested endpoints.
- Implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for enabling web applications running in different domains to make requests to this server.
- Uses the [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) router for routing and handling HTTP requests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Go React Giphy App Backend, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go (Golang)
- Required Go packages (dependencies) installed.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:michellesauder/giphy-app.git
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```shell
   go build
   ```

3. Run the server:
   from your server folder:

   ```shell
   go run main.go
   ```

   The server will start and listen on port 8080.

## Usage

- The server exposes various endpoints that can be accessed by the frontend application to retrieve Giphy data.

## API Documentation

The API endpoints and their descriptions are documented in the code within the `router` package.

## Configuration

You can configure server settings, such as the port it listens on and CORS options, in the `main` function of the `main.go` file.
